    These tests ensure the static transform publisher dies gracefully when
    provided with an invalid (or non-existent) transform parameter.

    These tests are started by the static_publisher.launch, which loads
    parameters into the param server.

    We check the output to make sure the correct error is occurring, since the
    return code is always -1 (255).

    Note that this *could* cause a problem if a valid TF is stored in the param
    server for one of the names; in this case the subprocess would never return
    and the test would run forever.
